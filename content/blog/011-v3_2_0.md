I am very excited to announce the release of Goa v3.2.0! This release includes
a few key improvements as well as many bug fixes.

## HTTP Cookies

v3.2.0 adds native support for HTTP cookies in Goa designs. Prior to this
release cookies could be read and written by Goa services using HTTP
middlewares that would read (or inject) the values from (into) the context.
For example:

```Go
// NOT NECESSARY ANYMORE
package cookie

type cookieKeyType int // private so key is unique
var CookieKey cookieKeyType = iota + 1

// ReadCookie returns a HTTP middleware that reads the value of the cookie with
// the given name and adds it to the request context under cookiectx.CookieKey.
func ReadCookie(name string) func(http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return func(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
        return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            c, err := req.Cookie(name)
            if err != nil {
                goto skip
            } 
            ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), cookiectx.CookieKey, c.Value)
            r = r.WithContext(ctx)
        skip:
            h.ServeHTTP(w, r)
        })
    }
}

// Usage:
// Mount middleware when creating the server:
srv := calcsvr.New(calcEndpoints, mux, dec, enc, eh, nil)
srv.Use(cookie.ReadCookie("session_uid"))

// Use the value from the context in the service methods:
func (s *Service) Endpoint(ctx context.Context, p *Payload) (*Result, error) {
    sessionUID := ctx.Value(cookie.CookieKey)
    // ...
}
```

Goa now makes it possible to provide the same functionality by simply adding
the following to the HTTP expression of the method:

```Go
// DO THIS INSTEAD
var _ = Service("session", func() {
    Method("use_session", func() {
        Payload(func() {
            Attribute("session_uid", String, "Session ID")
        })
        HTTP(func() {
            GET("/")
            Cookie("session_uid") // Load session ID from "SID" cookie
        })
    })
})
```

Note that the generated code does NOT make use of the context but instead
properly decodes the cookie into the payload (server side) or result (client
side). `Cookie` also makes it possible to write cookies into HTTP responses
(and read them client side).

See the [example](https://github.com/goadesign/examples/tree/master/cookies)
and [DSL doc](https://pkg.go.dev/goa.design/goa/v3@v3.2.0/dsl?tab=doc#Cookie)
for additional information.

## OpenAPI v3

This release also adds support for the
[OpenAPI v3.0.3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md)
specification. The `goa gen` tool now generates `openapi3.yaml` and
`openapi3.json` files under the `gen/http/` folder. This is in addition to
the already generated `openapi.yaml` and `openapi.json` files that contain
the OpenAPI v2 specification.

A big thank you to [Nitin Mohan](https://github.com/nitinmohan87) and
[Neenu Ann Varghese](https://github.com/NeenuAVarghese) for their help in
putting this together!

## API Level Errors

As a convenience Goa now makes it possible to define the transport specific
details of errors in the API expression. This makes it possible to provide
such details once and reuse them in multiple methods. Note that the services
and/or methods still need to explicitly declare the error (similar semantic
to `Reference`). For example:

```Go
var _ = API("test", func() {
    Error("bad_request")
    HTTP(func() {
        Response(StatusBadRequest, "bad_request")
    })
})

Service("Service", func() {
    Method("Method", func() {
        Error("bad_request") // No need to define transport details again
        Error("internal_error") // Method specific error, requires transport details
        HTTP(func() {
            GET("/one/two")
            Response("internal_error", StatusInternalServerError) // transport details
        })
    })
})
```

## And a lot more

The [complete list](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)
of changes from `v3.1.0` to `v3.2.0` includes many other improvements and
fixes, in particular:

* [Nitin Mohan](https://github.com/nitinmohan87) fixed an issue with cyclic result
  type definitions that could cause the `goa` tool to crash.
  ([#2517](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2517))
* [@ikawaha](https://github.com/ikawaha) fixed an issue with trailing slashes
  appearing in the generated path functions. The fix makes sure that if a
  relative path ends with `/` then it is preserved except in the case where the
  relative path is just `/`. In this case the slash is not added to the base
  path. The slash can be added in this case by using `./` instead of `/`.
  ([#2530](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2530))
  ([#2557](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/issues/2557)).
* [Taichi Sasaki](https://github.com/tchssk) helped finalize the setup of GitHub
  actions as a replacement for TravisCI on the `v3` branch.
  ([#2529](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2529))
  ([#2533](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2533))
* [@achow-flexera](https://github.com/achow-flexera) helped fix issues with the
  recently added `SkipRequestEncodeDecode`.
  ([#2532](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2532))
  ([#2543](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2543))
* [Taichi Sasaki](https://github.com/tchssk) also fixed the value of the
  Content-Type header used in HTTP responses that correspond to errors so
  that it would correctly honor any content type specified in the design via
  [ContentType](https://pkg.go.dev/goa.design/goa/v3@v3.2.0/dsl?tab=doc#ContentType).
  ([#2566](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2566))
* [Nitin Mohan](https://github.com/nitinmohan87) fixed an issue where the
  generated clients could not properly set the authorization bearer token.
  ([#2563](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2563)) 
* [Nitin Mohan](https://github.com/nitinmohan87) also fixed an issue where the
  conversions between snake_case and CamelCase could be inconsistent which could
  affect 
  [ConvertTo](https://pkg.go.dev/goa.design/goa/v3@v3.0.9/dsl?tab=doc#ConvertTo)
  and 
  [CreateFrom](https://pkg.go.dev/goa.design/goa/v3@v3.0.9/dsl?tab=doc#CreateFrom).
  ([#2568](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2563)) 
* [@mrsndmn](https://github.com/mrsndmn) fixed an issue where the
  `struct:field:name` tag would not work when used in conjunction with
  `error:field:name`.
  ([#2596](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2596))
* [Yamamoto Shun](https://github.com/shunyy) fixed an issue with the example code
  generated to handle graceful shutdown.
  ([#2603](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2603))
* [Yamamoto Shun](https://github.com/shunyy) also made sure the example code
  properly handles `SIGTERM` on top of `SIGINT` to trigger graceful shutdown.
  ([#2604](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2604))
